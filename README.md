# library-special-collections-buddhist-archives

This is an interactive map for spatially exploring Buddhist archival materials created by Jesse Drian, Buddhism Public Scholar for 
The Robert H. N. Ho Family Foundation Program in Buddhist Studies, Richard C. Rudolph East Asian Library, 
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

The map currently includes around 80 temples across North America, and lists all of the materials in the finding aids mentioning each place. At the moment, it primarily consists of materials from the Buddhist Churches of America archive as well as around 14 materials from the Oral Histories: Buddhist Traditions in Los Angeles digital collection.

Updates will be made periodically.
